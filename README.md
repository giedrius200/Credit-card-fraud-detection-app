# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection App (Tkinter + Machine Learning)

An interactive desktop application for **credit card fraud detection** built in Python using **Tkinter** for GUI and **machine learning models** for classification.  
Developed as part of my **Information Systems Engineering Bachelor's Thesis at Vilnius University**, this project combines data analysis, model training, visualization, and explainability (via SHAP) — all inside a single user-friendly interface.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The app allows users to:
- Upload transaction datasets (`.csv`)
- Analyze data (summary stats, correlations, class distributions)
- Choose between multiple ML algorithms  
- Adjust model parameters or use defaults  
- Train models using either **simple train/test split** or **5-fold cross-validation**
- View detailed metrics, confusion matrix, and SHAP explanations
- Predict on new datasets and compare metrics side-by-side

## 🧩 Features

✅ Graphical Interface built with **Tkinter** and **ttkthemes**  
✅ Built-in algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Neural Network (MLP)  
✅ Optional 5-fold cross-validation  
✅ SHAP value visualization for feature importance  
✅ Confusion Matrix and evaluation metrics display  
✅ MLP parameter experiments and exportable results  
✅ Threaded execution for smooth UI performance

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle:  
👉 [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Once downloaded:
1. Extract `creditcard.csv`
2. Place it inside the `data/` folder in this project:
   ```
   fraud_detection_app/
   └── data/
       ├── sample_train.csv
       └── sample_predict.csv
   ```

The `data/` folder includes **sample datasets** for both training and prediction —  
these are based on the **imbalanced credit card fraud dataset** and are intended for demonstration purposes only.

## ▶️ Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python code.py
```

1. Click **“Pasirinkti CSV failą”** to load your dataset  
2. Click **“Atlikti duomenų analizę”** to view summary and correlations  
3. Select an algorithm and adjust parameters if needed  
4. Click **“Apmokyti modelį”** to train and evaluate  
5. View:
   - Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC/PR AUC)
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - SHAP summary plot  
6. Use **“Nuspėti naujas klases”** to test predictions on new data
